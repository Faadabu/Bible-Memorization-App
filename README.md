## üß† How It Works

1. **Set Your Goal**:
   - Choose to memorize a Bible book (e.g. Jude), specific chapters, or custom verse sets.
   
2. **Study View**:
   - On the left: full Bible text displayed from your chosen file.
   - On the right: blank field for memory tests.

3. **Take Memory Test**:
   - Click the ‚ÄúMemory Test‚Äù button.
   - The left panel blurs.
   - The app shows verse number and dashes for the verse content.
   - Type your answer in the field on the right.
   - Get hints with every mistake (up to 5 tries).

4. **Feedback & Learning**:
   - Hints escalate gradually: first letter, second letter, etc.
   - If the verse is memorized correctly, it's saved to the review list.

5. **Spaced Repetition**:
   - Previously memorized verses are scheduled for future review automatically.
